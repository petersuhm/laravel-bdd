## Using BDD with Laravel

Many developers are confused about how they can go about doing BDD with a framework such as Laravel.

The purpose of this example code base is to showcase some common BDD concepts, and how to go about them in a Laravel concept.

I'm hoping to turn it in to some sort of interactive tutorial, where you can follow along by browsing through commits and pull requests. We will see how that comes along...

Hopefully, along the way, I'll learn a lot too.

Feel free to copy the code if there is anything you like!
